need to clean this up considerably.

todo:
- implement sadd
- possibly get rid of the initial 'ping' i put in the code.. don't think i need this anymore

experimental.. brief summary of why: watchque-c is crazy fast but it's out of control (code-wise). Wanted to see how fast I could develop watchque-hs and I'm curious as to how it will perform vs C/go/node etc.

still a few things left before watchque-hs == watchque-c in functionality.

development thus far has been very fast.

tmp: quick test syntax: check Makefile

make test_resque
make test_local
