need to clean this up considerably.

experimental.. brief summary of why: watchque-c is crazy fast but it's out of control (code-wise). Wanted to see how fast I could develop watchque-hs and I'm curious as to how it will perform vs C/go/node etc.

still a few things left before watchque-hs == watchque-c in functionality.

development thus far has been very fast.
